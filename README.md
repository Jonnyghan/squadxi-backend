Squad XI is an organizational tool for soccer coaches to keep track of their players throughout the season.

This repository, the back-end, was built using the Ruby On Rails framework in conjuction with a React/Redux frontend.

Rails- https://rubyonrails.org/


This app was created as a personal project turned assignment for Flatiron School. As a soccer coach I found it difficult to keep track of signed players as well as their positions. With 40+ new faces/levels of ability this gave me the opportunity to organize and visualize what I had to work with when games came along.
